The goal of the *Pyromania Project* is to test how terrestrial subsides (plant biomass loading or "browning") and burning influence aquatic productivity, water quality/chemistry, and trophic transfer. We used a manipulative experiment to assess a range of plant material quantities (0-400g per tank) and fire treatment (burned vs unburned material) and the non-linearity of these effects on aquatic systems through 4 time-point samplings. We used 400L aquatic mesocosms and ran the experiment for ~90d in 2021-2022.  
  

## File Directory  
The file directory contains folders and scripts (Rmd) to be run in RStudio. The folders house data, output, and raw + polished figures.  
   - *Pyromania.Rproj* = the R project for the analysis, load this first to allow code to run from correct directory in R Studio
   - *Pyromania Episode 1. Jump in the Fyya.Rmd* = the scripts and annotated code chunks here will walk through analyses and produce outputs
   - *Pyromania Episode 1. Jump in the Fyya.html* = the knit output of the Rmd file. Open this in any browser.
 
   - Folders
     - *data* = contains raw and processed data files
     - *figures* = contains raw exported figures from code and processed/cleaned figures in the *final.published* folder
     - *output* = contains the *scape.data.csv* file, used in generating isoscopes on x-y point system
     - *scripts* = contains pieces of scripts useful in analyses, generally integrated into Rmd

## Metadata
Important data files to generate maps, figures, and run models can be foudn in the *data folder*. The key data files are:
