## Pyromania  
  
Here we seek to test the influence of plant biomass loading (quantity) and the influence of fire (burned vs. unburned plant materials) on aquatic ecosystems. This is a collaboration between researchers at University of California San Diego (Jon Shurin Lab, Sara Jackrel Lab), University of California Irvine (Celia Symons), San Diego State University (Natalie Mladenov), and Scripps Institute of Oceanography (Jeff Bowman)
